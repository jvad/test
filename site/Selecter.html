	CSS selectors are used to determine which HTML element, or set of elements, to apply the CSS declarations to. The browser uses its selector API to traverse the DOM or Document Object Model, and pick out the elements matching the selector. Now crafting a selector is a great skill to have and not only for styling using CSS. That's because a lot of JavaScript libraries out there use the browser selector API to attach behavior and data to HTML elements. Much in the same way that CSS applies style to those elements. In this lecture, we're going to talk about three different types of selectors, element, class, and id selector.
